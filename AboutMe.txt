Welcome to Junjue's Homepage!
I am pursuing my master degree in Applied Mathematics at Northeastern University.
Unlike most of my classmates with enriched related experience, I am embracing this course from Level Zero. 
Hopefully by the end of the course, with my passion on web development, my insistance on everyday's hard-working, all the experiments and projects as building blocks, I can build up my first website successfully.
