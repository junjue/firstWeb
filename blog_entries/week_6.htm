        This week, I'm basically preparing for my final project, from design aspect to all related technical skills.</br>
        Since professor is mainly talking about setting up MEAN and Git, which I've already had some experiments 
        last week, I've decided to take this week to kick off my project.
        <h4>Orginize Code</h4>

        Since I was from Level Zero for web development, I did not have an overall view when I was coding. Luckily, from 
        now on, I've learned how to version control my code via Git and Github. So I began to re-organize my code, pushed them
        to Github. I've also learned how to use branch to safely update code then finally merge to my master branch. 
        This is really awesome since previously, I need to copy my files to other folders as backup. Now all I need is
        to create a new branch, commit or reset my HEAD to any version I want.</br>
        Git commands learnt:</br>
        git checkout -B new-branch-name: create new branch</br>
        git merge branch-name: merge branch to current branch</br>
        git reset HEAD: reset current changes to previous HEAD</br>
        git checkout -- file-name: reset changed file content</br>
        I also synchronized my github code to the openshift side. Saying, I'm working two version of experiments: both
        .NET server and MEAN server. </br>
        More importantly, now I have an understanding on how to build up my whole project. Such as some basic concepts for
        architecture like MVC(model, view and controller). In this case, my project could be more organized to be built up.</br>
        <h4>Form Validation</h4>
        Since I'll let users to login on my project website, login form would be very important. Sandeep also suggested me to 
        do this experiments. I've written JS to validate both user name and email format.</br>
        <h4>Google Maps Javascript API</h4>
        Since I've decided to build my project with something related to geolocation, I'm also getting started with trying to implemente maps to my website. I've completed two basic google map experiments.</br>
        The first one is to add Google Maps Javascript API to my website, create the map, add marker, add marker OnClickListener, add InfoWindow.</br>
        The second one is to create a simple direction web. Users can pick up some default places, it will show the direction from users' current location to the specific destination.

    <h3>
        TODO:
    </h3>
    <p>
        I've already had a general project plan. Will definately get started work next week for my project and create more 
        experiments related to the project next week.
