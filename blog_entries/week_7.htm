        As expected, I was getting started to build my final project this week. I've spent some time on planning my project. Meanwhile, I've finished several projects which we learnt this week from class, which I also think would benefit my project.
        <h4>Project Design</h4>
        Basically, I've mainly finished the front end design of my project. To make long story short, my final project would be a website tool to provide "extremely simple to use" service to NEU student to find place to eat. I've cleaned up all the basic technics that I need, MEAN, Google Map API, Bootstrap. Based on this, I've set up the very raw architecture of my project in the front end. For more info, please checkout my DEMO on openshift.

        <h4>Jquery Draggable UI</h4>
        With Jquery knowledge that learnt from class this week, I made several experiements on it. First one is a draggable UI, saying user can drag elements in the website to whereever they want.
        <h4>Jquery UI Sorting</h4>
        Besides draging the components to anywhere, for a good website, I believe I also need to sort the elements properly. In this experiement, all the draggable components can be sorted vertically. This would be very useful in my project.
        <h4>Image Slide</h4>
        Set a timer to automatically slide the images. This would be very useful in my project when I want to show the users different places to eat.
        <h4>Scroll Top</h4>

        Will continue working on my project. Need to improve the front end performance, meanwhile for the back end, I need to consider and implement the database with MongoDB.
