    Still working on project this week. Progressing slow but stable.
    <h4>Project Design</h4>
    While designing my project, I feel myself still lack of a general idea on how the framework works for a website. Moreover, I still need more knowledge on this. Based on this, I've read some materials on the structures and frameworks. To my understanding, since we should use MVC on both server side and client side, I've decided to build my project with the following framework:
    <ul>
      <li>On the server side:
    <li>Model: all the models and MongoDB
    <li>View: Express, NodeJS 
    <li>Controller: NodeJS, Express
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>On the client side:
    <li>Model: Javascript
    <li>View: CSS, JADE
    <li>Controller: Javascript
    </ul>

        <h4>Jquery Draggable UI</h4>
        With Jquery knowledge that learnt from class this week, I made several experiements on it. First one is a draggable UI, saying user can drag elements in the website to whereever they want.
        <h4>Jquery Login</h4>
        Login would be a very important component for my project. I'm trying to use Jquery for users to login frame.
        <h4>Jquery Add tag and grid</h4>
        In my project, there will be a page for users to add tags and tips. In this experiments, the users can click on button to add tips and tags designed by the web.
