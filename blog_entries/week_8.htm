    Still working on project this week. Progressing slow but stable.
    <h4>Project Design</h4>
    While designing my project, I feel myself still lack of a general idea on how the framework works for a website. Moreover, I still need more knowledge on this. Based on this, I've read some materials on the structures and frameworks. To my understanding, since we should use MVC on both server side and client side, I've decided to build my project with the following framework:
    <ul>
    On the server side:
    <li>Model: all the models and MongoDB
    <li>View: Express, NodeJS 
    <li>Controller: NodeJS, Express
  </ul>
  <ul>
    On the client side:
    <li>Model: Javascript
    <li>View: CSS, JADE
    <li>Controller: Javascript
    </ul>

        <h4>Multiview</h4>
        Continue working on MEAN, used AngularJS module to modify page elements.
        <h4>Jquery Login</h4>
        Login would be a very important component for my project. I'm trying to use Jquery for users to login frame, only response when user click on the login button instead of always be on the website.
        <h4>Jquery Add tag and grid</h4>
        I want to build up a website about food and recommendation around our school. Feedback is a very important part of my project. I give users two brief options which is adding a tag, one or two words long, or adding a tip, several sentences.
