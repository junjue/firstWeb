        This week, I've basically set up my MEAN website on openshift.</br>
        <a href="http://cs561001-junjue.rhcloud.com/">Lite Website</a></br>
        I decided to make this web site as a Lite version of my main CS5610 website, which includes all my stuffs: experiments,
        projects and blogs, but are hold be MEAN.</br>
        <h4>NodeJS</h4>
        It is implemented by expres().static. I've also updated my old aspx files index files so that it can be used on MEAN website.</br>
        At first, it was not working since it cannot include all my CSS files. </br>
        Tried to use module: connect(), static() and http(), however did not work. Later, I found express() is AWESOME!
        <h4>MongoDB</h4>
        I've learned several MongoDB commands:</br>
        db: show current database name</br>
        user "dbname": choose the db</br>
        show collections: show all collections. My understanding here is, the collection in MongoDB is kind of like the tables in SQL.</br>
        db.collection.find(): find all contents in specific collection. </br>
        <h4>Express</h4>
        This is powerful. With several lines of code, it can provide me the service.
        <h4>Git</h4>
        I've learned several basic git commands:</br>
            Init: used to initiate the repo.</br>
            Add: Each time I made changes, I need to add them for commit. Especially when added new file, need to move it from untracked to tracked.</br>
            Commit: Commit changes with logs.</br>
            Push: Sync remote repo with local repo.</br>
            Pull: Sync local repo with remote repo.</br>
        Previously, a lot of times when I made changes, it messed up. I cannot remember exactly which part of files did I change. With git, it's much better for me to control my code.
