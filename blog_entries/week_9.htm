        Continue working on project this week.
        <h4>Project Design</h4>
        Put a lot of efforts on designing Like button. Like button would be a very important component in my project, since all my venues info are based on users reviews. I want to use like button to collect user's feedback. Like buttons are widely used on lots of websites, like facebook and youtube. This is the simplest way to get feedback from users. Especially for lazy guys~ :)</br>
        I have to say, I drew the thumb up image and changed color for it in order to match my new homepage. Making my own icons was fun, but took me a lot of time... </br>
        I've also tried several ways to design the Like system, for instance, using one like button and one unlike button, or using only like button along with rating system. Currently, I decided to use the later one. Moreover, I tried to use Ajax to upload the like info, add the Like field in my project database. I'm also considering about concurrency issue, saying, if several users opened my page, the later user can get the latest like count if the other user added one after he open the page.
        <h4>FB and Twitter Like and Share</h4>
        Again, my project will focus on social features on different venues. User needs to be able share their opinions and tips on venues, so that the website can give future guest more information. Currently, I've added Facebook API and Twitter API. User can like the specific venue, and share all the tips to their friends.
