        Cause I have finished a project of another course which just dued on friday, I'm so sorry that I don't have enough time to finish all the experiments I want to do before Saturday's 5pm. I still working on experiments of weather and geolocation API, which using angular and jquery. I would finish those two by the end of this weekend.

    <h4>html</h4>
    <p>
        The new experiment is 003_insertMedia and 004_iframe which located in file 01_html. From these experiments, I've learned:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Insert media.</li>
        <li>Iframe</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    About these two experiments, I want to practice how to load video in the page. As an idea about my homepage, I think I need a window in my homepage which could play video or audio media. So I tried to insert media directly first. I found a piece of video from another ulr, I use <code>video></code>, but this didn't work. So after searched about this problem, I use <code>object</code> instead. It worked. And I noticed someone use iframe which could provide a 'smarter' frame to hold things, so I made another experiment about it. I tried to embed my homepage and change the size of the frame. And use <code>src</code> to embed the link of the video. <br />
    I would like to use iframe to embed websites and videos in my homepage.

    <h4>jQuery</h4>
    <p>
I created a new file which named 04_jquery. And the new experiment is 001_slideDown. From this experiment, I learnt:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Slide Down</li>
        <p>
            This is an experiment which I want to apply to my homepage too. I found users could control windows by using buttons. I use a function to controll object.slideUp and object.slideDown attributes. This could controll a class or a specific id of object. I remeber angular could use <code>show</code> or <code>hide</code> to achieve.
        </p>    
    </ul>
