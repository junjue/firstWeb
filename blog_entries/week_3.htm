    <h4>01: html</h4>
    <p>
        In new experiment 01_html, tried to learn:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Html Attributes. </li>
        <p>Such as <code>title</code>, to show a tooltip when you move your mouse over the object.</p>
        <p>Use <code>href</code> add links to other page or send emails by query string. You can open a new message with the receive address and a default subject.</p>
        <p>Use angular to change the size, like <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> of the picture by inputs. The size of the image would change when you input new values.</p>
        <li>Image Maps.</li>
        <p>Learn to use <code>map</code> and <code>area</code> of an image. If you click on the head of the panda or the pocky, there would be a bigger picture of it. Just like a map on the image.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>02: angular</h4>
    <p>
        I just start to learn angular and javascript, there's a lot of things I need to figure out. The first experiment I chose to do with angular is a register page. I think this page is widely used in our daily life. In my register page, I want to implement that if you input your information, before you submit to server or database, there should be a confirm page. The data you entered would transfer to the comfirmation page, which I tried by angular. This page needs to consummate, and I will keep working on it. I notice there's some bugs like you cannot enter information and 'submit' twice. I suppose to build a confirmation page with 'back' and 'submit' button to fix it. So, this is just the first virsion!
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Register Page</li>
        <p>
            Learn how angular works. Use <code>ng-app</code> <code>ng-model</code> and <code>ng-controller</code> to 'transfer' the input information by user. I want to show all the information together instead of show words when you're typing. So I use a list to store and show them after click the 'submit' button. 
        </p>
        <li>Order List</li>
        <p>Learn from Professor's lecture and combine with operations by using angular. Calculate the price of each item and get the total price by adding each item. Try to make script more clear to read.</p>
    </ul>

    <h4>About Homepage</h4>
