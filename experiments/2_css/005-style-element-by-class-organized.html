    <h1>CSS in specific element by class - organized

    <p class="red">
        <b>XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language)</b> is a family of XML markup languages that mirror or extend versions of the widely used Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the language in which Web pages are written.
    </p>

    <p class="bgYellow">
        While HTML (prior to HTML5) was defined as <i>an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)</i>, a very flexible markup language framework, XHTML is an application of XML, a more restrictive subset of SGML. Because XHTML documents need to be well-formed, they can be parsed using standard XML parsers, unlike HTML, which requires a lenient HTML-specific parser.
    </p>

    <p>
        XHTML 1.0 became a <s>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Recommendation</s> on January 26, 2000. XHTML 1.1 became a W3C Recommendation on May 31, 2001. The standard known as XHTML5 is being developed as an XML adaptation of the HTML5 specification.

    <p>
        After I copied those paragraphs above, I start to think about the encode about chinese in html. So I typed one chinese sentence. 
    </p>

    <p>
        尝试输入中文的结果。
    </p>

    <p>
        It worked.
        <br />
        English and Chinese could show successfully.

        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
