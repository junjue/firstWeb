    <h1>CSS in tag

    <p style="color: red">
        <b>XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language)</b> is a family of XML markup languages that mirror or extend versions of the widely used Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the language in which Web pages are written.
    </p>

    <p style="background:yellow">
        While HTML (prior to HTML5) was defined as <i>an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)</i>, a very flexible markup language framework, XHTML is an application of XML, a more restrictive subset of SGML. Because XHTML documents need to be well-formed, they can be parsed using standard XML parsers, unlike HTML, which requires a lenient HTML-specific parser.
    </p>

    <p>
        XHTML 1.0 became a <s>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Recommendation</s> on January 26, 2000. XHTML 1.1 became a W3C Recommendation on May 31, 2001. The standard known as XHTML5 is being developed as an XML adaptation of the HTML5 specification.

        After I copied those paragraphs above, I start to think about the encode about chinese in html. So I typed one chinese sentence.

        尝试输入中文的结果。
    </p>

    <p>
        It worked. <br />English and Chinese could show successfully.

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</li>
