    <h1>Head and paragraph in html</h1>

    <p>
        XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language) is a family of XML markup languages that mirror or extend versions of the widely used Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the language in which Web pages are written.
    </p>

    <p>
        While HTML (prior to HTML5) was defined as an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a very flexible markup language framework, XHTML is an application of XML, a more restrictive subset of SGML. Because XHTML documents need to be well-formed, they can be parsed using standard XML parsers, unlike HTML, which requires a lenient HTML-specific parser.
    </p>

    <p>
        XHTML 1.0 became a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Recommendation on January 26, 2000. XHTML 1.1 became a W3C Recommendation on May 31, 2001. The standard known as XHTML5 is being developed as an XML adaptation of the HTML5 specification.

    <h2>Thinking about encode</h2>

    <p>
        After I copied those paragraphs above, I start to think about the encode about chinese in html. So I typed one chinese sentence. 
    </p>

    <p>
        尝试输入中文的结果。
    </p>

    <p>
        It worked. English and Chinese could show successfully.
